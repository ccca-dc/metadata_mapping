This OWL file contains the metadata harmonization representation developed in frame of an Erasmus+ traineeship programme
performed at the Climate Change Centre Austria - Data Centre by Jelena Markovic, bacc. ing. geod. et geoinf., Faculty of Geodesy, Zagreb.
The traineeship was supervised by Mr. Chris Schubert, Director of CCCA Data Centre, and is a part of the Master Thesis
"Harmonisation of meteorological data in conformance with INSPIRE/OGC standards", authored by Jelena Markovic.

This harmonization contains metadata elements presented in ISO 19115 Geographic information - Metadata, INSPIRE Metadata
Regulation - (EC) No 1205/2008, WMO CORE 1.3, Metadata Profile for Open Government Data Austria (OGD-AT) and CKAN based
profile for CCCA MD elements. The metadata harmonization representation is based on RDF standard model and Web Ontology Language,
following specifications for applying the Simple Knowledge Organization System(SKOS). The representation was developed using
SKOS Editor plugin with Protégé 4.3 open software, creating a SKOS based OWL file containing harmonized metadata elements of
the above mentioned metadata standards and profiles.

The file was created in May, 2016. Current version of the file is 0.1.
